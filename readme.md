## Description

This is a modified version of the famous 8-bit game Battle City, a multi-directional shooter video game.

## Gameplay

Gameplay is similar to the original Battle City. Player controls a tank and shoot projectiles to destroy enemy tanks around the playfield. In contrast to the original, the opposing tanks randomly appear on the screen and aim to destroy both the player's tank and the player's base (represented by a flag). When all enemy tanks are destroyed, a level is finished and player can proceed to the next level. The game is over
if the player's base is destroyed or they run out of lives. Note that the player can destroy the base as well, so the
player can still lose even after all enemy tanks are destroyed.

## Control:

Player can control his/her tank using keyboard:

+ Up: ↑
+ Right: →
+ Down: ↓
+ Left: ←
+ Shoot: A
+ Pause: Enter 

There are also various buffs randomly appearing during the game. Player can shoot or go over them to get these extras!
