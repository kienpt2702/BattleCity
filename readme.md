## Description

This is a modified version of the famous 8-bit game Battle City, a multi-directional shooter video game.

## Gameplay

This and the first Battle City are essentially similar. A tank is controlled by the player, who fires projectiles at
nearby opponent tanks to destroy them. In contrast to the original, the opposing tanks now appear on the screen at
random times and aim to destroy both the player's tank and the player's base, which is shown on the screen as a flag
symbol. When all enemy tanks are destroyed, a level is finished and player can proceed to next level. The game is over
if the player's base is destroyed or they run out of lives. Note that the player can destroy the base as well, so the
player can still lose even after all enemy tanks are destroyed.

## Control:

Player can control his/her tank using keyboard:

+ Up: ↑
+ Right: →
+ Down: ↓
+ Left: ←
+ Shoot: A
+ Pause: Enter 

There are also various buffs randomly appearing during the game. Player can shoot or go over them to get these extras!
